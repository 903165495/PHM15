  "body": "### Welcome to PHM Data Challenge 2015\r\n\r\nThe PHM Data Challenge is a competition open to all potential conference attendees. This year\r\nthe challenge is focused on fault detection and prognostics, a common problem in industrial plant\r\nmonitoring. Participants will be scored on their ability to detect plant faults from a set of\r\npotential faults and additionally to precisely localize faults in time.\r\nThis is a fully open competition in which collaboration is encouraged. The teams may be\r\ncomposed of any combination of students, researchers, and industry professionals. The results\r\nwill be evaluated by the Data Challenge Committee and all teams will be ranked. The top scoring\r\nteams will be invited to present at a special session of the conference and first and second place\r\nfinishers will be recognized at the Conference Banquet event.\r\n\r\n### Data Challenge Chairs\r\n* Justinian Rosca, Siemens\r\n\r\n* Nicholas Williard, Schlumberger\r\n\r\n* Neil Eklund, Schlumberger\r\n\r\n* Zhen Song, Siemens\r\n\r\n### Teams\r\nThe team judged to have the first and second best scores will be awarded prizes of $600 and\r\n$400 respectively contingent upon:\r\n* Having at least one member of the team attend the PHM 2015 Conference\r\n* Presenting the analysis results and technique employed at a special session within the\r\nConference program\r\n* Submitting a peer-reviewed Conference paper. (Submission of the challenge special\r\nsession papers is outside the regular paper submission process and follows its own\r\nmodified schedule.)\r\nThe top entries will also be encouraged to submit a journal-quality paper to the International\r\nJournal of Prognostics and Health Management (ijPHM).\r\nThe organizers of the competition reserve the right to both modify these rules and disqualify any\r\nteam for any practices it deems inconsistent with fair and open practices.\r\n\r\n### Registration\r\nTeams may register by contacting the Competition organizers (justinian.rosca@siemens.com)\r\nwith their name(s) and a team alias under which the scores would be posted.\r\nPlease note: In the spirit of fair competition, we allow only one account per team. Please do not\r\nregister multiple times under different user names, under fictitious names, or using anonymous\r\naccounts. Competition organizers reserve the right to delete multiple entries from the same\r\nperson (or team) and/or to disqualify those who are trying to \"game\" the system or using\r\nfictitious identities.\r\n\r\n### Key Dates\r\nKey Conference Dates\r\nCompetition Open 5 June 2015\r\nCompetition Closed 29 Aug 2015\r\nPreliminary Winners Announced 6 Sep 2015\r\nWinners Announced 11 Oct 2015\r\nWinning Papers Due 14 Oct 2015\r\nPHM Conference Dates 19 Oct - 24 Oct 2015\r\n\r\n### Data\r\nThis year’s prognostics topic focuses on the operation of a plant and the capability to detect plant\r\nfailure events in advance. Data given represents: (a) time series of sensor measurements and\r\ncontrol reference signals for each of a number of control components of the plant (e.g. 6\r\ncomponents); (b) time series data representing additional measurements of a fixed number of\r\nplant zones over the same period of time (e.g. 3 zones), where a zone may cover one or more\r\nplant components; (c) plant fault events, each characterized by a start time, an end time, and a\r\nfailure code. Each plant is specific through its number of components and the number of zones.\r\nHowever each plant logs faults from the same fixed set of faults. Only faults of type 1-5 are of\r\ninterest, while code 6 represents all other faults not in focus. The frequency of measurements is\r\napproximately one sample every 15 minutes, and the time series data spans a period of\r\napproximately three to four years. The task is to predict future failure events of types 1-5 and the\r\ntime of their occurrence from past data.\r\n\r\nFor example, the data set for Plant #1 is given by a collection of three [.csv] files: plant-1a.csv,\r\nplant-1b.csv, plant-1c.csv. Each of the (a), (b), and (c) files contains information as described\r\nabove. More precisely the columns of each of the (a), (b), and (c) [.csv] file are:\r\na. Plant measurements per component: Component number “m”, time “t”, sensors “S1”-\r\n“S4”, and control references “R1”-“R4”\r\nb. Additional plant measurements per zone in the plant: zone number “n”, time “t”, sensors\r\n“E1” and “E2”\r\nc. Faults: Start time “t1”, end time “t2”, and fault code “F”.\r\nAdditionally, the following physical plant model information is provided:\r\n- Each plant component is controlled by a feedback loop system as represented in the\r\nfigure below; plant components are disjoint\r\n- Each zone measures cumulative energy consumed (E1) and instantaneous power (E2) in\r\ndisjoint sections of the plant covering one or more components\r\n- Faults are independent of one another. Also, a fault F is independent of data outside of a\r\nthree hour window of time before the fault start time.\r\nThe participants will have access to the following data sets:\r\n1. Training data for approximately thirty plants (e.g. see Plant 1 described above).\r\n2. Test data for approximately ten plants. For each test plant, the first half of the fault file\r\ndata is complete, while the second half is incomplete. Some faults of type 1-5 are\r\nmissing\r\n\r\n### Submission and Scoring\r\nEach team is permitted one submission a week on the test data. A correct submission will be\r\nrepresented by a zip archive [.zip] file with failure result files on the test data, whose name is the\r\nteam alias. If the team alias is “eagles”, then the filename will be “eagles.zip”. For each test fault\r\nfile plant-#c.csv, the submission should include a corresponding file named plant-#c-new.csv\r\nstating predicted missing faults in the test data. Each line of the [.csv] file should indicate a new\r\npredicted fault in the same format as the type (c) training data file plant-#c.csv. Thus each line\r\nshould specify the start time of the fault, the end time of the fault, and the fault type. Each\r\nsubmission will receive a score, as described below. Each team will be given the location to\r\nsubmit entries when they register.\r\n\r\nThe scoring system rewards correct detection (true positives or tp below) of a fault within a one\r\nhour tolerance of the time it actually occurs for each fault j, at any sampling time. It penalizes\r\nfalse positives (fp; other faults incorrectly classified as fault j) and false negatives (fn; fault j\r\nincorrectly classified as another fault). The overall prediction score of a plant test file is\r\ncomputed with a formula dependent on the table of confusion scores for the first N=5 fault\r\ncodes:\r\n\r\nThe overall prediction score of a submission will sum the scores for all test plants.\r\nThe Data Challenge committee will make available a validation set of data consisting of\r\napproximately ten plants, to be released before the final submission, based on which the final\r\nstanding will be decided. The submission with the highest score on the validation data will be\r\nthe winner of the data challenge competition.\r\nThe Data Challenge committee will regularly evaluate submissions on the unlabeled portion of\r\nthe test data, will report to each team the performance of their intermediate submissions, and will\r\npost the intermediate standing.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nThe data provided for the challenge is grounded in the real world and it is raw. It has\r\ninconsistencies, which should be taken into account, for example:\r\n1. The sampling interval is roughly 15 minutes, however variations may occur due to\r\nlogging delays. For example, line 1 in plant_1a.csv indicates a time stamp of 8/18//2009\r\n18:12, and ideally the hour stamp should be 18:00.\r\n2. Some data may be missing.\r\n3. Data intervals with non-increasing values of E1 are invalid, and should be disregarded.\r\nAn example could be seen in plant_25b.csv starting in row number 16253.\r\n### Questions\r\nQuestions about the data challenge will be answered on the challenge forum at\r\nhttp://www.phmsociety.org/forum/583\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nzhenieee@gmail.com",
